Hey ! I'm Juan 🤓 and this is my profile. I'm Senior Software Engineer mostly focused in Front-End in my work at **eBay** in the team that builds [*Kijiji Autos*](https://www.kijijiautos.ca/) which I joined in 2019 and is **awesome**. I'm from Spain 🇪🇸 but living in Berlin 🇩🇪.

I like **React** and **Typescript**, in my spare time I like to keep learning about Node.js while doing Open Source.

I'm trying to learn new things (when I have time), as *Rust*, *WebAssembly* or *Machine Learning* with Javascript.


###  My Work

![verdaccio](https://cdn.verdaccio.dev/readme/verdaccio@2x.png)

I've been contributing to Verdaccio since **2017**. I started fixing a broken test, then few more and somehow rewriting part of the project. Verdaccio was a fork of [*sinopia*](https://github.com/rlidwka/sinopia) which still share part of the architecture and ideas.

I've improved the plugin system adding the **Storage API** that allows create [storage plugins](https://github.com/verdaccio/monorepo/tree/9.x/plugins) and take the registry to the cloud. I've created few plugins as memory plugins for fast usage on CI tools, Google Cloud and *npm audit* support.

I also contributed on the official [Kubernetes Chart](https://github.com/verdaccio/charts) for Helm, the [plugin generator](https://github.com/verdaccio/generator-verdaccio-plugin) and the [Web User Interface](https://github.com/verdaccio/ui).

Furthermore, higly involved in a **big refactoring of Verdaccio (5.x)** while I maintain the current releases. 

I like to advocate about good practices using private registries and **helping the community to gain ownership of their own Node.js Private Registry**.

I do contribute other projects when I have little bit of time, but I'm mostly focused on Verdaccio 99% of my spare time.
