Hey ! I'm Juan ü§ì and this is my profile. I'm Senior Software Engineer mostly focused in Front-End in my work at **Adevinta**. 

I like **Javascript**, **React** and **Typescript**, in my spare time I like to keep coding **Node.js** while doing Open Source. Everything that has Javascript in the recipe is interesting to me.

I've been contributing to Verdaccio since **2017**.  I like to advocate about good practices using private registries and **helping the community to gain ownership of their own Node.js Private Registry**.
